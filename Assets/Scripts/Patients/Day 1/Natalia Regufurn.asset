  Newspaper: Natalia Regufum passed away of a heart attack last night. After her
    last visit to the ER relating to her heart issues, she was left with horrible
    debt, and decided to not go to the ER again during her last scare. Her heart
    stopped and without medical equipment, there was no restarting it.
